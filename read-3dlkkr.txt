which in turn is a vector extension of the scalar LEED
code by Pendry as described in his book on 

"Low Energy Electron Diffraction"
(Academic Press, London, 1974)

physical principles, you may find it useful to have a look

=========================================
The code extends of the Stefanou, Yannopapas, and Modinos (SYM) 
code by


1) incoporating the option of complex lattices.
In other words, it is also possible to perfom calculations
for not simple Bravais lattices. In doing so, the code
employs a general lattice summation decsribed in

J. M. McLaren, S. Crampin, D. D. Vvedensky, R. C. Albers,
and J. B. Pendry, \CPC{60}, 365-389 (1990).
Layer KKR electronic structure code for bulk and interface geometries.

2) incoporating the option of non-spherical scatteres.
At present, any axially symmetric scatterer is possible.

The code achieves that by incoporating Mishchenko code,
as improved in 

A. Moroz, "Improvement of Mishchenko's T-matrix code for absorbing 
  particles,"  Appl. Opt. 44(17), 3604-3609 (2005).

DICTIONARY: 

Specular R and T refers to what it would be in the case of an interface 
of two homogeneous media. Due to Bragg periodicity you may
have additionally several other non-specular reflected and trasmitted beams 
(i.e., reflected at different angle than is that of incident beam). 


=========================================

Let us take the triangular lattice as the first plane in the stack.
The stack is then formed by alternating triangular and kagome lattices.
The respective shift is the same for any two neighbouring 
layers of the stack.
In the parallel direction, the shift of the respective origins
of coordinates in the neighbouring planes is along the diagonal 
of a rhombus formed by the
two basis vectors of an underlying triangular lattice.
The half-length of the diagonal is according to the Pythagorean
theorem a*\sqrt{3}/2. The elementary shift along the diagonal is then

                  (a*\sqrt{3}/2)/3=a/(2*\sqrt{3})

The diagonal subtends with the x- (y-) axis the angle of 30 (60) degree.
Hence the elementary shift along the x-axis is, as expected

               \Delta_x= cos (30) * a/(2*\sqrt{3}) = a/4

whereas the elementary shift along the y-axis is

               \Delta_y= cos (60) * a/(2*\sqrt{3}) = a/(4*\sqrt{3})

The corresponding components of the DL, DR vectors should then 
be the halfs of the above shifts.

=========================================

The routines PCCSLAB and PCCSLABC are both for complex lattices.
The routine PCCSLAB is for spherical scatteres, whereas PCCSLABC
is intended for a scattere of general axial symmetric shape.

=========================================

CFAC=CONE if only if all the particles are in the plane, i.e.
have the very same "z" coordinate.

Otherwise, CFAC = exp (ci*kappa*dz)
where dz is the z-coordinate of a given particle.
=========================================



in the program it says that the rmuf(RTA) should be defined as rmuf(BSC)*sqrt(2), 
because in the RTA calculations the rmuf is not defined with respect to the 
cubic unit cell but with respect to the hexagonal primitive unit cell and 
because the conventional cubic unit cell has vector-length A=2. However, 
the fact that A=2 is not taken into account in the definition of 
rmuf(BSC) and therefore  the formula should be rmuf(BSC)/sqrt(2) 
 
If I would do sqrt(2)*rmuf(BSC)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/4, as suggested 
in the program, this yields 1/2
However, the unit hexagonal vector is four sphere radii long, so 
rmuf should be 1/4.
 
The unit Bravais lattice vector has a normalized length of 1, which is
by definition the center-to-center distance in 
between nearest-neighbour spheres. In the close-packed case the 
spheres are touching, which then corresponds to RMUF=1/2
as it should be.
 
In an fcc lattice, the nearest-neighbour spheres are for instance that 
in the center and in the corner of a given side of a conventional cubic unit cell. 
 
The edge and the side center form a isosceles rectangular triangle
with hypotenuse of length 2 and the legs of length 1.

=========================================

In the stack settings you can never ever have 

any of DR(3,*,*) or DL(3,*,*) equal to zer0!!!


By the very definition, DR's for each of the separate layers of the
stack defines a translation vectors which transfer the origin of coordinates
of a given layer to the right at the boundary, typically half in 
between the neighbouring layers in the stack. Since the layers are, 
by definition, at different heights along the stacking z-direction, 
DR(3,*,*) is never ever equal zero.



DL(*,*,iplane) then picks up the boundary point resulting from the action of
DR(*,*,iplane-1) on the origin of coordinate in the (iplane-1)th layer, 
and shifts the point again to the right towards the origin of coordinate 
in the (iplane)th layer. For the similar reasons, DL(3,*,*) is 
never ever equal zero.



A complex lattice within a given layer, which is formed by several
interpenetrating simple Bravais lattices is then unambigously
determined by POS vectors set-up in dlmsf2in3.f
 
=========================================


Look which option you have for RTA, i.e., if the specular option is on.

In the general case, both R and T is given by the specular and a
plurality ofnonspecular beams. The program only calculates 
independent quantities. A is then given simply as

A=1-R-T


In the case of nonabsorbing spheres you can still obtain a large value
of A if ynspc on on. 

In the latter case, only the specular beam contribution
to R and T is taken into account. Then clearly R+T<1 and A is nonzero.
Please, check if this is the case.


=========================================

 
Unlike nonzero A, T above 1 is a problem - it points to some bug.
 
As a remainder, 
 
- coordinates in "stack" are for connecting the respective origins 
of coordinates in different neighbouring layers of the stack;
 
- coordinates in "dlmsf2in3,f" are for the coordinates of different
 scatterers within the selected 2D unit cell  of a given layer of 
the stack w.r.t. to the origin of coordinates of the layer.
 
=========================================

All the lenghts are in the units of the basis vector AR1 of the
underlying Bravais
lattice, which is oriented along the -axis and has by default unit
length.

See the program lines

AR1(1)= ALPHA 
AR1(2)= 0.D0 

in caxsrefl3f.f


=========================================

Where does the program alternate IPLP between a layer with 1 particle
and a layer with 3 particles? Does that already happen in caxsrefl3d? Do
I have to define IPLP separately for every IPL?

===> caxsrefl3d first sets iplp=1

After the first visit to pccslabc.f is iplp reassigned to 2.
This "binary" option was chosen because of zinc blend,
wherein a unit slice is formed of two different layers.

Do I have to use pccslab.f or pccslabc.f?

===> pccslabc.f is for complex lattices (more than 1 scatterer per 2D
unit cell); pccslab.f is only for 2D Bravais lattices

Where is the core-shell structure of the particles defined? The core
shell structure is mentioned in caxsrefl3d, but I think finally only
EPSSPH is given into pccslab, which does not contain separate values for
core and shell.

===> have to check yet; as far as I remember, directly in tmtrxn.f
routine


=========================================


... a relative orientation of lattices is also important. Are the
respective lattices at the different stack floors in "parallel", i.e.,
one can select two primitive lattice vectors which are parallel?
